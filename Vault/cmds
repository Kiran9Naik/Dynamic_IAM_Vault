configuring the aws connection to the VAULT :
for generating Temp IAM


vault write aws/config/root \
  access_key=<access_key> \
  secret_key=<secret_key> \
  region=ap-south-1
I validated with:

vault read aws/config/root

create role with the attached policy to read/write on any service 

# s3-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:*"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

vault write aws/roles/s3-role \
  credential_type=iam_user \
  policy_document=@s3-policy.json \
  ttl=3600 \


vault read aws/creds/s3-role
These credentials worked perfectly with:

aws s3 ls
âœ… Confirmed: Access to S3 was working using short-lived IAM users!
